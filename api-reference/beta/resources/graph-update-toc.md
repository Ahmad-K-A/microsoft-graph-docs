# Add table of contents entries

**(Required)** Open either the beta or v1.0 toc.yml file in the branch that you created and add table of contents (TOC) entries for the APIs that you are adding. The TOC helps developers locate conceptual and API pages. For more information, see [Microsoft Graph TOC and Topic Title Guidelines](https://msgo.azurewebsites.net/add/document/guidelines/toc-and-topic-title.html).  

Note that sometimes a method is relevant and exposed in more than one context in the TOC, to show the potential of Microsoft Graph. For example, a user-centric method like sendMail appears under the Users >> Mail node and under the Mail >> Message node.
Think where your documentation should appear in the TOC, and the TOC titles you want to use. Base this off the existing TOC to maintain consistency across all the content. For more information about how content is structured, see [Microsoft Graph IA principles](https://msgo.azurewebsites.net/add/document/guidelines/ia-principles.html).
