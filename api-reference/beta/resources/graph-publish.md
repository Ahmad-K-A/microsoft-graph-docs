# Publish

**(Required)** Before the API documentation can be published, a content review is performed by the Content Developer and the Editor who merges PRs. After the review process is complete, incorporate any feedback that was provided in the PR. When all feedback has been incorporated, reviewers have signed off, and the APIs have been released live, set the label to **ready to merge**, enter **sign-off** as a comment, and then the articles will be published. 

PRs that are ready to merge are merged before 3 PM. All API Doctor and OPS build validation tests must pass before merging. At or after 3 PM daily, all PRs that have been merged into the master branch are pulled into the live branch to publish to the site.
