# Publish content

Before you can publish APIs on docs.microsoft.com, make sure that you complete the steps in [create content](graph-create-content.md)

The following table lists the steps for adding API content.

| Step | Required | Task | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| 1 | Yes | Create PR | After the stub files are created, and content and metadata are added, [create the pull request](https://msgo.azurewebsites.net/add/document/guidelines/manage-your-documentation.html) to start the publishing process. Be sure to address any [API Doctor errors](https://msgo.azurewebsites.net/add/document/guidelines/api-doctor-validate-examples.html) that may occur. |
| 2 | Yes | Review PR | Use the commenting capabilities of GitHub in the PR to share feedback and thoughts about the APIs.<br><br>The technical review generally creates a number of actions and changes. Content developers update what they can, but rely PMs or Engineers to provide additional technical details as needed.<br><br>The PR review process can be time consuming; however, it’s necessary to ensure technical accuracy, compliance, and completeness. If you’re on the review chain, you’ll need to approve the PR before it can be published. |
| 3 | Yes | Incorporate feedback and publish | After the review process is complete and reviewers have signed off, set the label to **ready to merge**, enter **sign-off** as a comment, and then the articles will be published. |
