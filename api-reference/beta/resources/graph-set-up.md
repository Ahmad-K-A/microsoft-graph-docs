# Set up environment

1. **(Required)** Notify the Content Development team that the documentation process is beginning for workload APIs and when the documentation is expected to go live. This may be a work item created in the documentation queue, or it might be an email sent to a Content Developer assigned to support the workload.
2. **(Optional)** If you are new to creating documentation, make sure that you are set up to use Markdown and GitHub. For more information about using GitHub and writing in Markdown, see:
    - [Docs Markdown Reference](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/help/contribute/markdown-reference?branch=master)
    - [Download Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
3. **(Required)** Create a working branch in GitHub. Always add or update content through a pull request from a personal branch. Do not use the Upload files button on GitHub. If you are submitting a set of changes, be sure to make all your changes in a single branch and not multiple separate branches. This improves processing and publishing efficiency. For more information, see the [Setting up your fork of the repository](https://msgo.azurewebsites.net/add/document/guidelines/manage-your-documentation.html#setting-up-your-fork-of-the-repository) and the [Create a new branch](https://msgo.azurewebsites.net/add/document/guidelines/manage-your-documentation.html#create-a-new-branch) sections of [Working with GitHub](https://msgo.azurewebsites.net/add/document/guidelines/manage-your-documentation.html).
