# Create API documentation 

Before you start adding content for publishing APIs on docs.microsoft.com, make sure that you complete the steps in [prerequisites](graph-prerequisites.md)

The following table lists the steps for adding API content.

| Step | Required | Task | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| 1 | Yes | Add descriptions and examples | When you completed the prerequisite steps, you created a set of markdown files that contain the format and CSDL information for the new APIs. The stub files that were created do not contain descriptions for the API or the properties of it. To do this, you need to be set up to use [GitHub](https://msgo.azurewebsites.net/add/document/manage-content/get-started-with-github.html). When adding markdown content for the API, be sure to follow the guidelines in [Autogenerate and author Microsoft Graph reference content](https://msgo.azurewebsites.net/add/document/guidelines/auto-generate-and-author-content.html) and [Microsoft Graph style guidelines](https://msgo.azurewebsites.net/add/document/guidelines/style.html).<br><br>As part of authoring, verify that the descriptions, permissions, properties, methods, relationships, and other details are correct and accurate. This includes relevant examples, request body, and response object examples. If your API relies on other prerequisites, licenses, or other details, include those as well.|
| 2 | Yes | Add metadata | Articles that are published on docs.microsoft.com require [metadata](https://msgo.azurewebsites.net/add/document/guidelines/metadata.html) to be able to identify the owner of the article, track usage, and facilitate search. |
| 3 | No | Create conceptual overviews | Developers often approach the Microsoft Graph with a scenario in mind and want to see it's supported. [Conceptual articles](https://msgo.azurewebsites.net/add/document/guidelines/conceptual-topics.html) let you showcase the value of your service or feature and provide valuable scenario information for your new APIs.<br><br>The service-level overviews are in the **Learn** section in the information architecture and apply to the explore stage of the developer’s journey. Major services and features have service-level overviews. These overviews describe the value and capabilities of a service. If you’re debuting a service or adding a significant API set to a service, make sure that you either include a service overview that provides the value proposition, or update an existing overview to include your APIs capabilities.<br><br>Because service-level overviews are intended to draw customer interest and should be kept reasonably light-weight (1-2 pages max), you can consider adding additional feature overviews and how-to conceptual topics for major features of your service.<br><br>API-level overviews apply to the **Develop** stage of the developer’s journey. Each corresponds to a service and describes concepts that help customers use the APIs of that service. API-level overviews must include common use cases, and can suggest best practices and preferred usage patterns. If you’re debuting a service or adding a significant API set to a service, make sure you have an API overview describing the use cases for the API. <br><br>Provide one service-level overview for a service across all versions. Similarly, feature overviews and how-to conceptual topics apply to all versions. Mark any API or feature that is only available in beta with “(preview)” in the TOC title, topic title, or section title, as applicable. Provide one copy of the API overview for each version, describing only APIs and use cases that are applicable to that version.|
| 4 | Yes | Add table of contents (TOC) entries | Your new APIs may need [TOC entries](https://msgo.azurewebsites.net/add/document/guidelines/toc-and-topic-title.html) in an existing API set or they may need a new TOC entry representing a new API set.<br><br>The table of contents helps developers locate conceptual and API pages. Think where your documentation should appear in the TOC, and the TOC titles you want to use. Base this off the existing TOC to maintain consistency across all the content. For more information about how content is structured, see [Microsoft Graph IA pricinples](https://msgo.azurewebsites.net/add/document/guidelines/ia-principles.html) Contact Laura Graham (lauragra@microsoft.com) to initiate updating and staging the TOC, or David Murray (davidmu@microsoft.com) for assistance with Intune/Azure AD TOCs. |
| 5 | Yes | Prepare changelog entries | All new APIs that are added to docs.microsoft.com must be included in the [change log](https://msgo.azurewebsites.net/add/document/guidelines/changelog.html). |

After adding the API content, the pages can now be [published](graph-publish.md) on docs.microsoft.com.
