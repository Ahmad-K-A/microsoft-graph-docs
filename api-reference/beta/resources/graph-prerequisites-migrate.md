# Prerequisites for migrating API documentation

Follow these prerequisite steps to migrate API documentation from beta to v1.0 in docs.microsoft.com.

## 1 - Create a doc work item

This is a required step. To start the migration process, create a [doc workitem](https://identitydivision.visualstudio.com/Technical%20Content/_workitems/create/Product%20Backlog%20Item?templateId=09046396-030b-451d-842b-9b0d931f50dc&ownerId=7eda0824-7eb2-4194-8319-b15a79747b34) with a proposed go-live date.

## 2 - Collect content

This is a required step. Review the beta documentation and make a list of all of the resources, APIs, and conceptual articles.

## Next steps

After creating the workitem and identifying the content to migrate, you can now [update content](graph-migrate-update.md) to get ready for migration.
