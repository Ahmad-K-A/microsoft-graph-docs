# Perform technical review

**(Required)** When requesting changes to the content, use the [GitHub review feature](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-request-reviews) and select **Request changes**. This indicates that the PR is not yet ready to merge. When your feedback has been addressed, change the review status on the PR to **Approved**. Only PRs with a status of **Approved** are merged even if the contributor has indicated that the PR is ready to merge.

The technical review generally creates several actions and changes. The PR review process can be time consuming; however, it is necessary to ensure technical accuracy, compliance, and completeness. If you are on the review chain, you will need to approve the PR before it can be published. When the content has been reviewed and revised to be technically accurate, set the label to **content review**.
