# List users

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Retrieve a list of [user](../resources/user.md) objects.

This operation returns by default only a subset of the more commonly used properties for each user. These _default_ properties are noted in the [Properties](../resources/user.md#properties) section. To get properties that are _not_ returned by default, do a [GET operation](user-get.md) for the user and specify the properties in a `$select` OData query option.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Permissions (from least to most privileged) |
|:--------------- |:------------------------------------------- |
| Delegated (work or school account) | User.ReadBasic.All, User.Read.All, User.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All, Directory.AccessAsUser.All |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. |
| Application | User.Read.All, User.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /users
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the [OData Query Parameters](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/docs/concepts/query_parameters) to help customize the response including `$search`, `$count`, and `$filter`. You can use `$search` on displayName and description properties. When items are added or updated for this resource, they are specially indexed for use with the `$count` and `$search` query parameters. There can be a slight delay between when an item is added or updated and when it is available in the index.

## Request headers

| Header | Value |
|:------ |:----- |
| Authorization | Bearer {token} (required)  |
| ConsistencyLevel | The value is always `eventual`. This header is required when using the `$search`or `$count` query parameter. |

## Request body

Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and collection of [user](../resources/user.md) objects in the response body.
