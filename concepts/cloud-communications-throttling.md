# Throttling

When we refer to *throttling* calls, this means that we limit how many incoming and outgoing calls a developer or organization can make or receive per month.

### Why?
We set limits on how many established calls can be made or received per month because we want to make sure that our platform is stable, reliable, and secure. Too many calls from one source could mean that it is hogging resources or intentionally being malicious.

### Limits

As of now, the monthly throttling limit is **10,000 calls** per month.

As of now, we permit up to **100 concurrent calls** per month.

If you own a business, this means that every month, **for free**, you can make or receive up to 10,000 calls, where no more than 100 calls are going on at the same time.

>**Note:** These limits are subject to change in the future

Once you reach your throttling limit, attempting to create more calls will result in a `429 Error`.
