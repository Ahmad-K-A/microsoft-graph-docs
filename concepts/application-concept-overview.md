# Overview of applications in Microsoft Graph

An application that has been integrated with Azure AD has implications that go beyond the software aspect. "Application" is frequently used as a conceptual term, referring to not only the application software, but also its Azure AD registration and role in authentication/authorization "conversations" at runtime.
